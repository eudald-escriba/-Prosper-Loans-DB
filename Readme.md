### Project Title
Prosper Loans DB.Data Analysis and Visualisation.

### Description

The main purpose of this project is to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among multiple variables. 

Specifically, we are going to take into consideration the analysis of the following aspects:

- First of all we will look to see which American States have asked for more loans, as well as the typical time to return the money.

- On the other hand we are going to analyze the years when more loans were asked and in what months of the year the consumers had more tendency to ask for loans.

- A third block will allow us to discover if the Principal Borrowed depends or not on the salary as well as the number of delinquents in the last seven years.

- Finally, we will analyze if the temporal evolution of the Borrower Rate depends on the return term.

### The Dataset

This project is on a data set from Prosper, which is Americaâ€™s first marketplace lending platform, with over $7 billion in funded loans. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information. As well, there is a dictionary with all the terms used in this context. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0
